# Inventory Management System using AI

## Project Overview
This is a simple AI-based Inventory Management System.
The system helps manage products, stock, and sales data.
It also predicts low stock situations using past sales data.

## Objectives
- Manage inventory digitally
- Track stock in and stock out
- Store sales records
- Predict low stock
- Reduce manual errors

## Features
- Admin login
- Add, update, delete products
- Stock in and stock out
- Sales record tracking

- Low stock alert

## AI Logic
The system analyzes previous sales data.

Average daily sales is calculated and used to estimate
how many days the current stock will last.
If the remaining days are low, the system shows an alert.

## System Flow
1. Admin login
2. Product management
3. Stock update
4. Sales data storage
5. Sales analysis
6. Low stock prediction
7. Alert display

## Flowchart
A flowchart is included to show the complete system workflow.

## Project Scope
- Suitable for small businesses
- Beginner-friendly
- Easy to extend

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how simple AI logic
can be applied to solve real-life inventory problems.
